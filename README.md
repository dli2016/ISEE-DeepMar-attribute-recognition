# ISEE-DeepMar-attribute-recognition
It is about the code to call the caffe model to do attributes recognition. The model, named DeepMAR [1], is provided by Dangwei Li (dangwei.li@nlpr.ia.ac.cn).

Note: the code here is only an example to call the model using Java. And the project of DeepMar and RAP dataset are supported by Dangwei Li but NOT dli1988@126.com (Da Li). Please cantact with him (dangwei.li@nlpr.ia.ac.cn) for any problems.
